Hello there! I am a Synthetic Biology PhD student at the [National University of Singapore SynCTI](https://syncti.org/) advised by [Julius Fredens](https://www.genomeeng.org/) and [Yew Wen Shan](https://synenzyme.org/).
My research focuses on developing new tools for directed evolution in the laboratory. I am interested in developing and utilizing tools to accelerate genetic diversificaton (hypermutagenesis), and enrichment and isolation of improved mutants (selection). The ultimate goal is to accelerate discovery of new-to-nature functions in biological systems to enable environmental sustainability, create new foods and materials, and improve human health

Before starting my PhD in Synthetic Biology, I
