  title={Functional composite microbeads for cell-based meat culture: effect of animal gelatin coating on cell proliferation and differentiation},
  author={Yan Kong, Shujian Ong, Mei Hui Liu, Hanry Yu and Dejian Huang},  
  abstract={Hydrogel microbeads are promising matrices for cell-based meat culture because they can be conveniently fabricated from food-grade materials. In this study, food-grade sodium alginate was successfully applied to fabricate edible microbeads with the desired diameters (∼200 µm) using electrospray technology. Pure alginate microbeads have poor cytoaffinity. To enhance the cytoaffinity of alginate microbeads for meat culture, we applied different gelatin coatings, namely porcine gelatin, bovine gelatin, and fish gelatin, onto alginate beads. The modification is non-toxic and environmentally friendly with the use of plant-derived crosslinkers and under mild reaction conditions. As all ingredients are food grade, the modified microbeads are edible and biodegradable, with the mean diameters of 142.96 ± 35.49 μm (porcine gelatin-coated beads), 105.12 ± 80.46 μm (bovine gelatin-coated beads), and 94.81 ± 67.38 μm (bovine gelatin-coated beads). These modified microbeads have self-fluorescence and can be easily distinguished under a fluorescent microscope. The hydrogel core enables the microbeads to have a density of 1.04 g cm−3 for suspension culture. Bovine gelatin-coated microbeads have the best primary porcine myoblast and C2C12 cell adhesion, and can achieve between 16- to 18-fold proliferation of different muscle cells. With the successful differentiation of C2C12 and proliferation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes on bovine gelatin-coated microbeads, cells and microbeads can form clusters, illustrating that our edible microbeads are promising microcarriers for mammalian cell culture for cell-based meat production.},

  author={Shujian Ong, Larry Loo, Marion Pang, Russell Tan, Yao Teng, Xuanming Lou, Sze Khen Chin, Mihir Yogesh Naik, Hanry Yu},  
  abstract={Recent efforts for cell-based meat cuts focus on engineering edible scaffolds, with visual cues which are key to enhancing consumer acceptance, receiving less attention Here, we employed artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening of potential plant materials and discovered that jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) has the natural structures to recapitulate marbling visuals of meat cuts. Plant tissue compositions are exploited for its differential polyphenol adsorption to produce complex marbling patterns. A one-step colour control method by varying oxidation and incubation conditions of polyphenols was developed to produce permanent meat-like colours resembling chicken, pork, and beef. The scaffold exhibits a meat-like browning behaviour when cooked and is shown to support high-density porcine myoblasts culture without masking the marbled appearance. Surveys with 78 volunteers found that marbled jackfruit scaffolds improved consumer perception of cell-based meat by ∼8%. Our approach of combining AI, tissue engineering, and sensory science unlocks the possibility of creating a range of novel cell-based meat cuts with consumer focus.},

  title={Cell-based meat: Current ambiguities with nomenclature},
  author={Shujian Ong, Deepak Choudhury, May Win Naing},  
  abstract={Cell-based meats have arose substantial interest due to the promotion of these products as cleaner and sustainable alternatives to conventional meats. We identify the most notable ambiguities surrounding the nomenclature of cell-based meats and summarize current discussions around it. Notable ambiguities include: whether cell-based meat can be called “meat”; identifying the most descriptive and appealing name for cell-based meat; the nomenclature of cell-based meat products with different levels of complexity; and the standards cell-based meats need to meet before claiming to be cleaner and more sustainable than conventional meat. The need to clarify ambiguities is crucial to facilitate discussions, enhance investor interests, build consumer confidence and prevent any future strife with traditional farming.},

  title={Cost-effective robust synthesis of methacrylic cellulosic sponge for organoid culture},
  author={Zheng Liu, Farah Tasnim, Shujian Ong, Sabrina Shen, Xiao Zhong Huang, Eliza Li Shan Fong & Hanry Yu},  
  abstract={We previously reported the development of a three-dimensional cellulosic sponge capable of constraining hepatocytes within macropores to support the rapid formation of organoids with preserved hepatocyte functions for hepatotoxicity testing applications. Fabrication of this macroporous sponge involves conjugating allyl groups onto hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) to serve as crosslinking sites during gamma irradiation following thermally-induced phase separation. However, this method requires the use of moisture-sensitive reagents and unstable organic solvents which introduces batch-to-batch variability. To address this problem, we developed a cellulosic sponge system which replaces the use of allyl groups as cross-linkers with methacrylic groups to generate methacrylic-HPC (MA-HPC) under fully aqueous conditions. The resulting MA-HPC sponge contains macropores (94 ± 8 μm, 90% porosity) to constrain cells to form organoids, and has an average elastic modulus of 8.5 kPa that is close to the modulus of native rat and human livers. We demonstrate that similar to the allyl-based sponge, the MA-HPC sponge reliably supports human hepatocyte organoid culture and maintains high level cellular functions for at least 1 week in culture, thereby providing a reliable alternative to the existing allyl-based sponge for organoid culture.},
